Filter out reconstructed events that don't pass cuts

\subsection*{Data}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Read in a collection of reconstruction results from a {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} object
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item From {\ttfamily Reco\-Info}, or from a map
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item For every event that passes criteria (fiducial volume, reconstruction tool, etc.)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Write out into new {\ttfamily Reco\-Info} object
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Configuration}

\subsubsection*{The parameters saying what to filter}

``` reconstruction\-\_\-algorithm A\-L\-G\-S\-T\-R\-I\-N\-G min\-\_\-recon\-\_\-likelihood L\-I\-K\-E\-L\-I\-H\-O\-O\-D min\-\_\-recon\-\_\-time\-\_\-likelihood L\-I\-K\-E\-L\-I\-H\-O\-O\-D max\-\_\-r\-\_\-pos D\-I\-S\-T\-A\-N\-C\-E max\-\_\-z\-\_\-pos D\-I\-S\-T\-A\-N\-C\-E ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily reconstruction\-\_\-algorithm} Use the results of which reconstruction algorithm?
\item {\ttfamily min\-\_\-recon\-\_\-likelihood} Events with a likelihood smaller than this will not be included in dimfit calculations
\item {\ttfamily min\-\_\-recon\-\_\-time\-\_\-likelihood} Events with a time-\/fit likelihood smaller than this will not be included in dimfit calculations
\item {\ttfamily max\-\_\-r\-\_\-pos} Events with larger reconstructed {\ttfamily r} (in cm) than this will not be included in dimfit calculations
\item {\ttfamily max\-\_\-z\-\_\-pos} Events with larger reconstructed {\ttfamily z} (in cm) than this will not be included in dimfit calculations
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that this is a detector half-\/height because the co-\/ordinate origin is at the detector centre
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Input/output}

``` input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name N\-A\-M\-E output\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name N\-A\-M\-E ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name} Name of the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} object to take from the map {\ttfamily Reco\-Info\-Map}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If A\-L\-L takes the all reconstructed events from the global object {\ttfamily Reco\-Info}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily output\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name} Name of the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} object to save in the map {\ttfamily Reco\-Info\-Map}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Cannot be A\-L\-L
\item Cannot be the same as {\ttfamily input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily outfilename} File path to output file
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Misc}

``` verbose L\-E\-V\-E\-L ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily verbose} Verbosity level. Runs from 0 (low verbosity) to 9 (high verbosity) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
