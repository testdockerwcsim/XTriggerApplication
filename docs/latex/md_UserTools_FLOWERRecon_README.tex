\hyperlink{classFLOWERRecon}{F\-L\-O\-W\-E\-R\-Recon} will take a reconstructed vertex (and hits from the associated trigger) from the \hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\-Model} and run the F\-L\-O\-W\-E\-R low-\/energy reconstruction algorithm

\subsection*{Data}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Performs setup of F\-L\-O\-W\-E\-R reading in from the \hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\-Model}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Geometry from {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-Geom\-Tree}
\item P\-M\-T dark rate from {\ttfamily I\-D\-P\-M\-T\-Dark\-Rate}
\item Number of P\-M\-Ts from {\ttfamily I\-D\-N\-P\-M\-Ts}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item For each reconstructed vertex that pass a filter (see {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconFilter}{Recon\-Filter}})
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Read in the vertex from the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}}
\item Get the hits in the trigger from {\ttfamily I\-D\-W\-C\-Sim\-Event\-\_\-\-Triggered}
\item Run the F\-L\-O\-W\-E\-R external program to get the reconstructed energy
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Configuration}

\subsubsection*{Parameters that specify which reconstructed events to use}

``` input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name N\-A\-M\-E nhitsmin N\-U\-M nhitsmax N\-U\-M ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name} Name of the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} object to take from the map {\ttfamily Reco\-Info\-Map}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If A\-L\-L takes the all reconstructed events from the global object {\ttfamily Reco\-Info}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily nhitsmin} When the number of hits in the trigger is below this number, F\-L\-O\-W\-E\-R will not be called
\item {\ttfamily nhitsmax} When the number of hits in the trigger is above this number, F\-L\-O\-W\-E\-R will not be called
\end{DoxyItemize}
