\hyperlink{classDataOut}{Data\-Out} takes W\-C\-Sim pass through information and trigger results, writing out a new T\-File with only the triggered digits, and some extra variables so that triggered events can be linked with W\-C\-Sim events

\subsection*{Data}

\hyperlink{classDataOut}{Data\-Out}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Creates an output {\ttfamily T\-File}
\item Sets up 3 T\-Trees
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily wcsim\-Geo\-T} has 1 entry and is a direct clone of the input tree

{\ttfamily wcsimrootgeom} of type {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-Root\-Geom} is the only branch
\item {\ttfamily wcsim\-Root\-Options\-T} has N input file entries

{\ttfamily wcsimrootoptions} of type {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-Root\-Options} is a direct clone of the input tree

{\ttfamily wcsimfilename} of type {\ttfamily T\-Obj\-String} is the W\-C\-Sim file this options class came from
\item {\ttfamily wcsim\-T} has N events entries
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily wcsimrootevent} of type {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-Root\-Event} stores the I\-D events. This is identical to the W\-C\-Sim event tree, with digits outside the trigger window removed$\ast$
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-Root\-Event} with removed digits can be accessed by other tools using {\ttfamily I\-D\-W\-C\-Sim\-Event\-\_\-\-Triggered} in the data model
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily wcsimrootevent\-\_\-\-O\-D} of type {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-Root\-Event} stores the O\-D events. This is identical to the W\-C\-Sim event tree, with digits outside the trigger window removed$\ast$
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-Root\-Event} with removed digits can be accessed by other tools using {\ttfamily O\-D\-W\-C\-Sim\-Event\-\_\-\-Triggered} in the data model
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily wcsimfilename} of type {\ttfamily T\-Obj\-Array} of {\ttfamily T\-Obj\-String} stores the W\-C\-Sim filename(s) of the current event
\item {\ttfamily wcsimeventnums} of type {\ttfamily vector$<$int$>$} stors the W\-C\-Sim event number(s) of the current event
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item $\ast$\-Any digit that is not in a trigger window is removed from the output {\ttfamily T\-Clones\-Array}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is done using a combination of {\ttfamily I\-D\-Triggers} and {\ttfamily O\-D\-Triggers} that triggers have filled
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item e.\-g. if an O\-D digit is doesn't have any O\-D triggers, but is within an I\-D trigger window, the O\-D digit will be saved
\item This is different to W\-C\-Sim which handles I\-D/\-O\-D triggers separately
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The logic of which trigger to add a digit too is\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Time order the triggers
\item It is then the first trigger the digit is in
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item If there are no trigger windows, every digit will be removed
\item Digits that are triggered, but not in the 0th trigger window, are added to the relevant window before removal from the 0th trigger
\item Caveat\-: turning {\ttfamily save\-\_\-only\-\_\-failed\-\_\-hits} on will save only digits that don't pass a trigger
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Truth tracks are also moved into their corresponding trigger window
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item However the logic is slightly different (since they are never dropped)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If they are in the 0th trigger readout window, store in 0th trigger
\item If they are after the 0th readout window and before the end of the 1st trigger window, store in the 1st trigger
\item etc
\item But note that W\-C\-Sim\-Root\-Trigger object aren't created just for tracks, therefore if the track time is beyond the last trigger window, it is stored in the last trigger
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that this is not exactly equivalent to W\-C\-Sim. W\-C\-Sim uses a fixed \char`\"{}`trigger\-\_\-time` + 950 ns\char`\"{} for this check, rather than \char`\"{}`trigger\-\_\-time` + `postrigger\-\_\-save\-\_\-window`\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Configuration}

``` outfilename /path/to/file verbose L\-E\-V\-E\-L save\-\_\-multiple\-\_\-hits\-\_\-per\-\_\-trigger \mbox{[}0,1\mbox{]} trigger\-\_\-offset O\-F\-F\-S\-E\-T save\-\_\-only\-\_\-failed\-\_\-hits \mbox{[}0,1\mbox{]} ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily outfilename} File path to output file
\item {\ttfamily verbose} Verbosity level. Runs from 0 (low verbosity) to 9 (high verbosity)
\item {\ttfamily save\-\_\-multiple\-\_\-hits\-\_\-per\-\_\-trigger} is a boolean flag. If false, will only allow one digit per P\-M\-T per trigger window to be written. If true, writes out as many as exist
\item {\ttfamily trigger\-\_\-offset} Offset applied to trigger time to account for {\ttfamily W\-C\-Sim\-W\-C\-Trigger\-Base\-::offset} constant (set to 950 ns by default). This is related to S\-K\-I delay in the electronics/\-D\-A\-Q
\item {\ttfamily save\-\_\-only\-\_\-failed\-\_\-hits} is a boolean flag. If false, will do the normal triggering behaviour -\/ save only digits that pass a trigger. If true, will do the opposite -\/ save only digits that don't pass a trigger
