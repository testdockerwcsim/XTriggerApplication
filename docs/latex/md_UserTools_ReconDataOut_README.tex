Write out a new file with a {\ttfamily T\-Tree} storing reconstruction information

\subsection*{Data}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sets up a {\ttfamily T\-Tree} called {\ttfamily recon\-Tree} which is filled with the result of every reconstruction taken from the data member {\ttfamily Reco\-Info} (or {\ttfamily Reco\-Info\-Map})
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Event\-Num}
\item {\ttfamily Trigger\-Num}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily N\-Digits}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Reconstructer} an enumeration of the tool that reconstructed (e.\-g. k\-Recon\-B\-O\-N\-S\-A\-I)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\-O\-D\-O it is currently cast to an int. Need to setup a root linkdef to allow the enum to be used directly in the tree
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Time}
\item {\ttfamily Vertex\mbox{[}3\mbox{]}} x,y,z
\item {\ttfamily Goodness\-Of\-Fit}
\item {\ttfamily Goodness\-Of\-Time\-Fit}
\item {\ttfamily Has\-Direction} boolean saying whether the reconstruction tool provides direction
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{structDirectionEuler}{Direction\-Euler}\mbox{[}3\mbox{]}} theta (zenith), phi (azimuth), alpha
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{structCherenkovCone}{Cherenkov\-Cone}\mbox{[}2\mbox{]}} cos(\-Cherenkov angle), ellipticity
\item {\ttfamily Direction\-Likelihood}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Configuration}

``` input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name N\-A\-M\-E outfilename /path/to/file verbose L\-E\-V\-E\-L ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name} Name of the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} object to take from the map {\ttfamily Reco\-Info\-Map}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If A\-L\-L takes the all reconstructed events from the global object {\ttfamily Reco\-Info}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily outfilename} File path to output file
\item {\ttfamily verbose} Verbosity level. Runs from 0 (low verbosity) to 9 (high verbosity) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
