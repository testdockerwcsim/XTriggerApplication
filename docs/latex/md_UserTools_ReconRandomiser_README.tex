Produce randomised vertex distributions

Multiple versions of the tools can be run in a tool\-Chain to create complicated event distributions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item e.\-g. to add a volume-\/like distribution on top of a point-\/like distribution
\end{DoxyItemize}

Optionally
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Apply smearing (emulating reconstruction, to 0th order) (T\-O\-D\-O)
\item Apply fixing points on a grid (emulating fixed grid-\/based reconstruction, to 0th order)
\item Also produce directions (T\-O\-D\-O)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Data}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Writes output to {\ttfamily Reco\-Info}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Likelihoods and \hyperlink{classNHits}{N\-Hits} are set to a large number, so they are always accepted by future tools
\item The Reconstructer type is set to {\ttfamily k\-Recon\-Random\-No\-Direction} or {\ttfamily k\-Recon\-Random}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Configuration}

\subsubsection*{Vertex distribution}

``` n\-\_\-vertices\-\_\-mean N

x\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos P\-O\-S x\-\_\-width W\-I\-D\-T\-H y\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos P\-O\-S y\-\_\-width W\-I\-D\-T\-H z\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos P\-O\-S z\-\_\-width W\-I\-D\-T\-H

max\-\_\-z\-\_\-pos F\-L\-O\-A\-T max\-\_\-r\-\_\-pos F\-L\-O\-A\-T

flat\-\_\-r B\-O\-O\-L ```

Specify the simulated vertex distribution to generate.

In order to create a uniform distribution, set {\ttfamily max\-\_\-z\-\_\-pos} and {\ttfamily max\-\_\-r\-\_\-pos} to the size of your detector, and {\ttfamily x\-\_\-width}, {\ttfamily y\-\_\-width}, {\ttfamily z\-\_\-width} all to negative values
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily n\-\_\-vertices\-\_\-mean} Poisson mean of the number of vertices to generate
\item {\ttfamily x\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos} The mean {\ttfamily x} position (cm)
\item {\ttfamily x\-\_\-width} The width of the Gaussian in {\ttfamily x (cm)}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If 0, no throws
\item If $<$0, throw uniformly between {\ttfamily ±max\-\_\-r\-\_\-pos}. In this case, {\ttfamily x\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos} is ignored
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily y\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos} The mean {\ttfamily y} position (cm)
\item {\ttfamily y\-\_\-width} The width of the Gaussian in {\ttfamily y} (cm)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If {\ttfamily 0}, no throws
\item If {\ttfamily $<$1\-E-\/6}, throw uniformly between {\ttfamily ±max\-\_\-r\-\_\-pos}. In this case, {\ttfamily y\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos} is ignored
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily z\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos} The mean {\ttfamily z} position (cm)
\item {\ttfamily z\-\_\-width} The width of the Gaussian in {\ttfamily z} (cm)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If 0, no throws
\item If $<$0, throw uniformly between {\ttfamily ±max\-\_\-z\-\_\-pos}. In this case, {\ttfamily z\-\_\-mean\-\_\-pos} is ignored
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily max\-\_\-r\-\_\-pos} Events with larger {\ttfamily r} (in cm) than this will be rethrown
\item {\ttfamily max\-\_\-z\-\_\-pos} Events with larger {\ttfamily $|$z$|$} (in cm) than this will be rethrown
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that this is a detector half-\/height because the co-\/ordinate origin is at the detector centre
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily flat\-\_\-r} If this is true, and both {\ttfamily x\-\_\-width} and {\ttfamily y\-\_\-width} are negative (i.\-e. generating a random distribution in the circularly plane), use this to generate a flat distribution in {\ttfamily r} (rather than flat in {\ttfamily x} and {\ttfamily y})
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Time distribution}

``` t\-\_\-min T\-I\-M\-E t\-\_\-max T\-I\-M\-E ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily t\-\_\-min} Times are generated uniformly in the range {\ttfamily t\-\_\-min} to {\ttfamily t\-\_\-max} (ns)
\item {\ttfamily t\-\_\-max} Times are generated uniformly in the range {\ttfamily t\-\_\-min} to {\ttfamily t\-\_\-max} (ns)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Misc}

``` nevents N seed S\-E\-E\-D verbose L\-E\-V\-E\-L ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily nevents} Run Execute() this number of times. If not given or negative, will revert to 1
\item {\ttfamily seed} The random seed to use. Default 0 (always different, but not reproducable!)
\item {\ttfamily verbose} Verbosity level. Runs from 0 (low verbosity) to 9 (high verbosity) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
