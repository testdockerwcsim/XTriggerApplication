\hyperlink{classSupernovaDirectionCalculator}{Supernova\-Direction\-Calculator}

\subsection*{Data}

The \hyperlink{classSupernovaDirectionCalculator}{Supernova\-Direction\-Calculator} iterates over all reconstructed vertices provided by an input filter and calculates the average event direction. This is should correspond to the supernova neutrino direction.

\subsection*{Configuration}

Describe any configuration variables for \hyperlink{classSupernovaDirectionCalculator}{Supernova\-Direction\-Calculator}.

``` input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name filter1 weight\-\_\-events 1 weights\-\_\-file configfiles/\-S\-N\-Triggering/\-S\-N\-\_\-dir\-\_\-weights.\-txt use\-\_\-stopwatch 1 \#stopwatch\-\_\-file dimfit\-\_\-stopwatch.\-pdf verbose 3 ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name} Which filter to use as input.
\item {\ttfamily weight\-\_\-events} Whether to weight events by their reconstructed energy.
\item {\ttfamily weights\-\_\-file} Path to the C\-S\-V file containing the events
\item {\ttfamily verbose} Verbosity level. Runs from 0 (low verbosity) to 9 (high verbosity)
\item {\ttfamily use\-\_\-stopwatch} Use the Stopwatch functionality implemented for this tool?
\item {\ttfamily stopwatch\-\_\-file} Save the time it takes for each run of {\ttfamily Execute()} to a histogram. Should end in .pdf, .eps, etc.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{The weights file}

The file containing the weights needs to look like this\-:

``` log10\-\_\-\-Energy,weight 0.\-22297752156211326,0.\-0 0.\-29327299363978826,0.\-0016633804259996556 0.\-3635684657174633,0.\-006585896779828453 0.\-4338639377951383,0.\-010466441505762652 0.\-5041594098728133,0.\-02799834738253676 ... ```

The first line describes the columns. It will be ignored by the tool. The first column contains the {\ttfamily log10(\-E\-\_\-reco)} values, the second column the weights to be applited.

The actual weights will be calculated by interpolating the given values. Events with energies out of range will be given the weight corresponding to the first/last entry in the file.
