Read a {\ttfamily recon\-Tree} {\ttfamily T\-Tree} into the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} of {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\-Model}}

\subsection*{Data}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sets up a {\ttfamily T\-Chain} for {\ttfamily recon\-Tree} using {\ttfamily infilenames} as the filename(s)
\item For every entry in the tree
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add an entry to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} in the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\-Model}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item W\-A\-R\-N\-I\-N\-G\-: {\ttfamily Execute()} sets {\ttfamily Stop\-Loop} to {\ttfamily true}, therefore any toolchains using this tool in \char`\"{}infinite-\/loop mode\char`\"{} is limited to only run {\ttfamily Execute()} once
\item W\-A\-R\-N\-I\-N\-G\-: if you use this tool in a toolchain with a fixed number of {\ttfamily $>$1} events, the same data will be added to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} every time (i.\-e. the entire {\ttfamily T\-Chain} is added to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} every event)
\end{DoxyItemize}
