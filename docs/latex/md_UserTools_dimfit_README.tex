dimfit analyses the distribution of reconstructed vertices and determines whether the dimensonality corresponds to\-: \begin{TabularC}{2}
\hline
\rowcolor{lightgray}{\bf D }&{\bf Explanation  }\\\cline{1-2}
0 &Point-\/like \\\cline{1-2}
1 &Line-\/like \\\cline{1-2}
2 &Plane-\/like \\\cline{1-2}
3 &Volume-\/like \\\cline{1-2}
\end{TabularC}
Supernovae should appear volume-\/like

Backgrounds should appear non-\/volume-\/like. e.\-g.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Radioactive sources should appear point-\/like
\item Muon-\/induced backgrounds should appear line-\/like
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Data}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Over a sliding time window
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reads reconstructed event information from {\ttfamily Reco\-Info} in data model
\item For reconstructed events that pass a filter (see {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconFilter}{Recon\-Filter}}), or all events, fill a vector of positions
\item If there are enough events that pass the criteria, run dimfit
\item Printout the result of dimfit
\item Compare the number of reconstructed vertices to the thresholds for golden, normal and silent warnings
\item Pass dimensionality, nclusters and highest nclusters\-\_\-warning passed to data model
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Configuration}

\subsubsection*{Parameters that specify which reconstructed events to use}

``` input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name N\-A\-M\-E min\-\_\-events N\-U\-M time\-\_\-window D\-U\-R\-A\-T\-I\-O\-N time\-\_\-window\-\_\-step S\-I\-Z\-E ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily input\-\_\-filter\-\_\-name} Name of the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classReconInfo}{Recon\-Info}} object to take from the map {\ttfamily Reco\-Info\-Map}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If A\-L\-L takes the all reconstructed events from the global object {\ttfamily Reco\-Info}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily min\-\_\-events} When the number of events in the sliding time window is below this number, dimfit will not be called
\item {\ttfamily time\-\_\-window} Duration of the sliding time window, in seconds
\item {\ttfamily time\-\_\-window\-\_\-step} Step size for the sliding time window, in seconds
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{dimfit running parameters}

``` R2\-M\-I\-N N\-U\-M L\-O\-W\-D\-B\-I\-A\-S N\-U\-M G\-O\-O\-D\-P\-O\-I\-N\-T N\-U\-M M\-A\-X\-M\-E\-A\-N\-P\-O\-S N\-U\-M ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily R2\-M\-I\-N} The chisq must be above this value to reconstruct as volume-\/like
\item {\ttfamily L\-O\-W\-D\-B\-I\-A\-S} Bias chisq towards/away from(???) volume-\/like
\item {\ttfamily G\-O\-O\-D\-P\-O\-I\-N\-T} If the chisq is less than this, always return point-\/like
\item {\ttfamily M\-A\-X\-M\-E\-A\-N\-P\-O\-S} If the average vertex position is outside a sphere of radius {\ttfamily M\-A\-X\-M\-E\-A\-N\-P\-O\-S}, don't return volume-\/like
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{nclusters running parameters}

``` nclusters\-\_\-silent\-\_\-warning N\-U\-M nclusters\-\_\-normal\-\_\-warning N\-U\-M nclusters\-\_\-golden\-\_\-warning N\-U\-M ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily nclusters\-\_\-silent\-\_\-warning} The number of vertices needed to trigger a silent warning
\item {\ttfamily nclusters\-\_\-normal\-\_\-warning} The number of vertices needed to trigger a normal warning
\item {\ttfamily nclusters\-\_\-golden\-\_\-warning} The number of vertices needed to trigger a golden warning
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Misc}

``` verbose L\-E\-V\-E\-L ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily verbose} Verbosity level. Runs from 0 (low verbosity) to 9 (high verbosity) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
