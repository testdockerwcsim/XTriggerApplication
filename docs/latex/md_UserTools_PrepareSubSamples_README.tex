\hyperlink{classPrepareSubSamples}{Prepare\-Sub\-Samples} will take the provided Sub\-Samples in the \hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\-Model} and make them correspond to the expected format from real data. Specifically it will\-:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Sort all digits in the Sub\-Samples by their time.
\item Split Sub\-Samples that are too long into multiple (slightly overlapping) ones.
\item Ensure positive, small digit times by adjusting the timestamp of each \hyperlink{classSubSample}{Sub\-Sample}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Data}

\hyperlink{classPrepareSubSamples}{Prepare\-Sub\-Samples} will change/replace the I\-D and O\-D Sub\-Samples in the \hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\-Model} if necessary.

\subsection*{Configuration}

``` sample\-\_\-width W\-I\-D\-T\-H sample\-\_\-overlap O\-V\-E\-R\-L\-A\-P verbose L\-E\-V\-E\-L ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily sample\-\_\-width} The (maximum) width of each \hyperlink{classSubSample}{Sub\-Sample} in ns
\item {\ttfamily sample\-\_\-overlap} The overlap of consecutive samples in ns
\item {\ttfamily verbose} Verbosity level. Runs from 0 (low verbosity) to 9 (high verbosity)
