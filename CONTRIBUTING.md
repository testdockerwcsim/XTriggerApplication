# Coding conventions

Try to adhere to these coding conventions if possible. They ensure a cleanly
readable code throughout the project:

*   Use two spaces for indentation
*   Use `UpperCamelCase` for class names
*   Use `UpperCamelCase` for methods
*   Use `snake_case` for variables
*   Add a `m_` prefix to member variables
*   Add a `s_` prefix to static member (i.e. class-) variables
*   `ALL-CAPS` enums, implementation constants, and the like, e.g. `s_LONG_TIME`.
*   Explain your code with helpful (!) comments, ideally using Doxygen syntax
